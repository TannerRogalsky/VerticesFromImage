This is a small tool for obtaining vertices from an image.
It is ideal for simplifying the process of creating an accurate hitbox from an image when dealing with a 2D physics engine.

TODO:
- make more efficient: takes about 15 seconds to run through a 250*250 image while only hitting every fifth pixel
- add other image type support besides PNGs
- add the ability to specify the level of detail/number of vertices returned
